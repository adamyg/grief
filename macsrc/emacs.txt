        C-c C-q     indent the whole function according to indention style

        C-c C-u     go to beginning of this preprocessor statement
        C-c C-c     comment out marked area

    More general (I guess)
        M-x outline-minor-mode collapses function definitions in a file to a mere {...}
        M-x show-subtree If you are in one of the collapsed functions, this un-collapses it
        In order to achive some of the feats coming up now you have to run etags *.c *.h *.cpp (or what ever ending you source files have) in the source directory
M-. (Thats Meta dot) If you are in a function call, this will take you to it's definition
M-x tags-search ENTER Searches through all you etaged
M-, (Meta comma) jumps to the next occurence for tags-search
M-x tags-query-replace yum. This lets you replace some text in all the tagged files


    GDB (Debugger)
        M-x gdb     starts up gdm in an extra window

    Version Control

        C-x v =     show diff between versions
        C-x v u     remove all changes since last checkin
        C-x v ~     show certain version in different window
        C-x v l     print log
        C-x v i     mark file for version control add
        C-x v h     insert version control header into file
        C-x v r     check out named snapshot
        C-x v s     create named snapshot
        C-x v a     create changelog file in gnu-style
