        This directory contains the macros which are loaded as a
        result of setting the 'GRKBDPATH' environment variable.

 These
        files set the global list variable, kbd_labels, which is used
        by Grief in the int_to_key() primitive if the labels on your
        keyboard are not necessarily in correspondence with a PC
        keyboard.

        For example, you might have a META key rather than an ALT key.

        The format of this list is a sequence of pairs, where the
        first element of the pair is the internal key-code (an int)
        and the second part of the pair is the string to use for that
        keycode.

        Only the key-sequences not compatible with the default
        characteristics of int_to_key() should be defined.
