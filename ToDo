        * stream functions, for example; could model from php interface? (http://php.net/manual/en/ref.stream.php)

             Description of Stream Functions
                stream_create
                    STREAM stream_create(string filename,int read,int append);

                    Creates a file stream, a tcp stream, an udp stream a syslog stream
                    or a RS232/RS485 stream (see example 2 and example 3)

                    filename:   Stream specification

                        Value                       Description
                        /path/filename              File-Stream
                        #tcp:/server-address/port   TCP-Stream
                        #udp:/server-address/port   UDP-Stream

                    read:       If stream is a file stream: 1 = read file; 0 = write file
                    append:     1 = append text to file; 0 = overwrite text in file

                stream_printf
                    void stream_printf(STREAM stream,string format, ...);

                    Writes to the output buffer of the specified stream a sequence of
                    data formatted as the format argument specifies. After the format
                    parameter, the function expects at least as many additional
                    arguments as specified in format.

                 stream_write
                    int stream_write(STREAM stream,void* ptr,int size);

                    Writes an array of size elements, from the block of memory pointed
                    by ptr to the to the output buffer of the specified stream (see
                    example 2).

                    The postion indicator of the stream is advanced by the total number
                    of bytes written.

                    The total number of elements successfully written is returned. If
                    this number differs from the size parameter, it indicates an error.

                stream_flush
                    void stream_flush(STREAM stream);

                    If the given stream is a file stream and the file was opened for
                    writing any unwritten data in the output buffer is written to the
                    file (see example 2).

                    If the given stream is a tcp stream, an udp stream or a syslog
                    stream any data in the output buffer is sent to the server.

                stream_read
                    int stream_read(STREAM stream,void* ptr,int size,int timeout);

                    Reads an array of size elements from the input buffer of the
                    specified stream and stores them in the block of memory specified
                    by ptr (see example 2).

                    The timeout is given in milliseconds. The postion indicator of the
                    stream is advanced by the total amount of bytes read. The total
                    number of elements successfully read is returned.

                stream_readline
                    int stream_readline(STREAM stream,void* ptr,int maxsize,int timeout);

                    If the given stream is a file stream the next line of the file is
                    read. The maximal number of elements to read is specified with
                    parameter maxsize. The timeout is given in milliseconds.

                stream_close
                    void stream_close(STREAM stream)

                    Closes the specified stream and deallocates all memory used by the stream.

                If unspecified, the format is cleared and the echo_line() set taken effect.

                The meaning of the fields is:

                        %m      mode string (ie. --------rw).
                        %o      If overwrite mode, expands to "OV" otherwise " ".
                        %O      overwrite/insert flag - like %o, but shows OV/RE.
                        %l      current line number.
                        %L      number of lines in the file.
                        %T      current time --- only used if variable DISPLAY_TIME is non-zero.
                        %v      crisp version.
                        %%      literal '%' character.

                all other characters are quoted.

                Note:   Once set only FROZEN or flags=0 (disable) has effect.
