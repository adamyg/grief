dnl CF_CONST_X_STRING version: 7 updated: 2021/06/07 17:39:17
dnl -----------------
dnl The X11R4-X11R6 Xt specification uses an ambiguous String type for most
dnl character-strings.
dnl
dnl It is ambiguous because the specification accommodated the pre-ANSI
dnl compilers bundled by more than one vendor in lieu of providing a standard C
dnl compiler other than by costly add-ons.  Because of this, the specification
dnl did not take into account the use of const for telling the compiler that
dnl string literals would be in readonly memory.
dnl
dnl As a workaround, one could (starting with X11R5) define XTSTRINGDEFINES, to
dnl let the compiler decide how to represent Xt's strings which were #define'd.
dnl That does not solve the problem of using the block of Xt's strings which
dnl are compiled into the library (and is less efficient than one might want).
dnl
dnl Xt specification 7 introduces the _CONST_X_STRING symbol which is used both
dnl when compiling the library and compiling using the library, to tell the
dnl compiler that String is const.
