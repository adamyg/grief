The organization of this archive is determined by the tools which I
use for updating scripts and macros in configure-scripts.

The scripts in the top-level directory are stable- or improved versions of
scripts needed for autoconf.

The COPYING file applies to the contents of the AcSplit directory.

The files in AcSplit are the autoconf macros which I use for maintaining
several programs, including ncurses, xterm, lynx, vile.  They are
maintained in a split form, one macro per file.  I wrote utilities to
split/join these (acsplit/acmerge) in August 1997, and much later (April
2003) wrote a checkin-script which provides the version numbers in each
file.

The files are named according to the macro they contain.  A few are
customized or improved versions from other packages.  All of the ones
which I wrote are named using a "CF_" prefix.  A few macros are useful
only for specific programs; most are useful building blocks for the
configure scripts which I maintain.

As an aside, one may note CF_CHECK_DECL, etc., from 1997.  Those were
plagiarized by one of the autoconf maintainers in 1999.
