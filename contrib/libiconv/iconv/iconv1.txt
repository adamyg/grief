ICONV(1)                NetBSD General Commands Manual                ICONV(1)

NAME
     iconv -- codeset conversion utility

SYNOPSIS
     iconv [-cs] -f from_name -t to_name [file ...]
     iconv -f from_name [-cs] [-t to_name] [file ...]
     iconv -t to_name [-cs] [-f from_name] [file ...]
     iconv -l

DESCRIPTION
     The iconv utility converts the codeset of file (or from standard input if
     no file is specified) from codeset from_name to codeset to_name and out-
     puts the converted text on standard output.

     The following options are available:

     -c    Prevent output of any invalid characters.  By default, iconv out-
           puts an ``invalid character'' specified by the to_name codeset when
           it encounters a character which is valid in the from_name codeset
           but does not have a corresponding character in the to_name codeset.

     -f    Specifies the source codeset name as from_name.

     -l    Lists available codeset names.  Note that not all combinations of
           from_name and to_name are valid.

     -s    Silent.  By default, iconv outputs the number of ``invalid
           characters'' to standard error if they exist.  This option prevents
           this behaviour.

     -t    Specifies the destination codeset name as to_name.

EXIT STATUS
     The iconv utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
