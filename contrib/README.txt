  extags/

        Author: Darren Hiebert <dhiebert at users.sourceforge.net>

            Exuberant Ctags is a multilanguage reimplementation of the much-underused
            ctags(1) program and is intended to be the mother of all ctags programs. It
            generates indexes of source code definitions which are used by a number of
            editors and tools. The motivation which drove the development of Exuberant
            Ctags was the need for a ctags program which supported generation of tags
            for all possible C language constructs (which no other ctags offers), and
            because most were easily fooled by a number of preprocessor contructs.

            No components of Exuberant Ctags are included within Grief, other then
            the 'public domain' readtags.c module, which is utilised to read tags file
            generated by Exuberant.

            Exuberant Ctags is seperately licensed under the GNU GPL; see the source
            for details.

            zlib 1.2.7 is a general purpose data compression library. All the code is
            thread safe. The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
            (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
            http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950 (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format)

          Acknowledgments:

            The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate and
            zlib specifications were written by L. Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the
            people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib;
            they are too numerous to cite here.

  libbzip2/

        o bzip2 1.0.8

            The bzip2 file compression program was developed by Julian Seward and
            launched on the 18th of July in 1996. It has remained an open source
            program, available to all for free, for over twenty two years now. The last
            stable release was seven years ago.

            The version 1.0.6 was released on the 20th of September in 2010. bzip2
            compression program is based on BurrowsWheeler algorithm. The program can
            compress files but cannot archive them. Julian Seward is still in charge of
            maintaining the program.

            The compression application works on all major operating systems and is
            available as a BSD-like license. The program uses .bz2 as its filename
            extension, application/x-bzip2 as the media type on internet and
            public.archive.bzip2 as the uniform type identifier.

  liblzma/

        o xz utils 5.2.3

            XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with a high
            compression ratio. XZ Utils were written for POSIX-like systems, but also
            work on some not-so-POSIX systems. XZ Utils are the successor to LZMA Utils.

            The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on LZMA SDK, but it has
            been modified quite a lot to be suitable for XZ Utils. The primary
            compression algorithm is currently LZMA2, which is used inside the .xz
            container format. With typical files, XZ Utils create 30 % smaller output
            than gzip and 15 % smaller output than bzip2.

         XZ Utils consist of several components::

             o liblzma is a compression library with an API similar to that of zlib.

             o xz is a command line tool with syntax similar to that of gzip.

             o xzdec is a decompression-only tool smaller than the full-featured xz tool.

             o  A set of shell scripts (xzgrep, xzdiff, etc.) have been adapted from gzip to ease viewing, grepping, and comparing compressed files.

             o Emulation of command line tools of LZMA Utils eases transition from LZMA Utils to XZ Utils.

            While liblzma has a zlib-like API, liblzma doesn't include any file I/O
            functions. A separate I/O library is planned, which would abstract handling
            of .gz, .bz2, and .xz files with an easy to use API.

          Copyright notice:

            Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here is a
            rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this package (but
            check the individual files to be sure!):

                - liblzma is in the public domain.

                - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public domain
                unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked in from the lib
                directory. The getopt_long code is under GNU LGPLv2.1+.

                - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
                adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are under GNU
                GPLv2+.

                - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the XZ Utils
                specific documentation files in other directories are in the public
                domain.

                - Translated messages are in the public domain.

                - The build system contains public domain files, and files that are
                under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up in the
                binaries being built.

                - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
                utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.

                - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files that
                are under various free software licenses.

  libguess/

        o libguess-1.1

            libguess - high-speed character set detection

            libguess is a high speed, open source character set encoding detector.
            libguess employs discrete-finite automata to deduce the character set of
            the input buffer. The advantage of this is that all character sets can be
            checked in parallel, and quickly.

            libguess is fully reentrant, using only local stack memory for DFA operations.

            Right now, libguess passes a byte to each DFA on the same pass, meaning
            that the winning character set can be deduced as efficiently as possible.
