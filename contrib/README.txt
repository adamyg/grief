  extags/

        Author: Darren Hiebert <dhiebert at users.sourceforge.net>

            Exuberant Ctags is a multilanguage reimplementation of the much-underused
            ctags(1) program and is intended to be the mother of all ctags programs. It
            generates indexes of source code definitions which are used by a number of
            editors and tools. The motivation which drove the development of Exuberant
            Ctags was the need for a ctags program which supported generation of tags
            for all possible C language constructs (which no other ctags offers), and
            because most were easily fooled by a number of preprocessor contructs.

            No components of Exuberant Ctags are included within Grief, other then
            the 'public domain' readtags.c module, which is utilised to read tags file
            generated by Exuberant.

            Exuberant Ctags is seperately licensed under the GNU GPL; see the source
            for details.

  libz/

        o ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY

            zlib 1.2.7 is a general purpose data compression library. All the code is
            thread safe. The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
            (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
            http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950 (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format)
            and rfc1952 (gzip format).

                                -------------

          Acknowledgments:

            The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate and
            zlib specifications were written by L. Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the
            people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib;
            they are too numerous to cite here.

  libguess/

        o libguess-1.1

            libguess - high-speed character set detection

            libguess employs discrete-finite automata to deduce the character set of
            the input buffer. The advantage of this is that all character sets can be
            checked in parallel, and quickly. Right now, libguess passes a byte to each
            DFA on the same pass, meaning that the winning character set can be deduced
            as efficiently as possible.
