        Oniguruma is a regular expressions library.

        Oniguruma by K. Kosako is a BSD licensed regular expression
        library that supports a variety of character encodings.

        The Ruby programming language, since version 1.9, as well as
        PHP's multi-byte string module (since PHP5), use Oniguruma as
        their regular expression engine. It is also used in products
        such as Tera Term, TextMate, Sublime Text and SubEthaEdit.

        Oniguruma is Japanese for "Devil's Chariot".
