Title:          History

        The *GRIEF* Editor, despite the fact this package was only
        formally released in 2013, its development has its roots from
        the 80's as a Brief clone. This version of the editor has
        been actively used since the 1998.

Topic:          Authors

        As for it development the main history milestones and authors
        are as follows.

   Dave Conroy:

        Author of the public domain *MicroEmacs* upon which *GRIEF*
        was originally based.

        *MicroEMACS* is supported on a variety of machines and
        operating systems, including MS-DOS VMS and UNIX (several
        versions); which can be found within CUG archives.

        Since that time a number of variations have been developed, 
        such as MicroGNUEmacs (or mg) and uEmacs/PK.

   Paul Fox:

        Using MicroEmacs as a basis *Paul* *Fox* developed the
        original Crisp as an UnderWare Inc's, later Borland 3.1
        BRIEF(tm) clone/emulation, targeted for Unix(tm) and VMS.

        This packages was known as *CRISP*, the 'Custom' 'Reduced'
        'Instruction' 'Set' 'Programmers' 'Editor'.

        The last public release was Crisp 2.2 in 1991 prior to
        becoming that is now *CRiSP* Visual Text Editor, 

        Paul Fox's personal site is <http://www.crisp.demon.co.uk>, 
        with the commercial site being <http://www.crisp.com>.

(code)
        CRiSP is a programmers text editor designed to give user the
        power and flexibility to edit large files on multiple Unix, 
        Linux, Windows and Mac platforms.

        CRiSP started life as a programmers text editor with BRIEF
        emulation, however after 15+ years of development, it now
        includes just about every conceivable editing feature that
        you could ever feel a need for, while still maintaining BRIEF
        keyboard and macro emulation.
(end)
        
        Paul Fox no longer maintains nor supports the Crisp 2.2 version.

        Crisp was based in part on a mix of public domain and
        specialised components, included MicroEmacs.

        The final source and several earlier versions can be found on
        old mail archive sites.

        *GRIEF* has no connection with the current commercial product.

   Adam Young:

        Heavily modified, replaced and extended the publicly released
        crisp2.2 to become what is now the *GRIEF* Editor.

Topic:          Brief

        *Brief*, *BRIEF*, or *B.R.I.E.F.*, an acronym for 'Basic'
        'Reconfigurable' 'Interactive' 'Editing' 'Facility', was a
        programmer's text editor in the 1980s and early 1990s.

        It was designed and developed by UnderWare Inc, a company
        founded in Providence, Rhode Island by 'David Nanian' and
        'Michael Strickman', and was published by 'Solution Systems'
        and later Borland.

        In 1990, UnderWare sold BRIEF to Solution Systems which
        released version 3.1.

        Borland later purchasing BRIEF and the full suite of software
        tools from Solutions Systems.

        Solution Systems closed permanently after the sale to
        Borland. Much to our loss, BRIEF is no longer sold by Borland.
