Title:          Third Party Packages

        *GRIEF* development would not be possible without the work of
        others.

        The following packages are normally only required for Windows
        builds as all are generally available on other targets, either as
        standard or optional installations.

Topic:          Common Modules

        A number of source modules have been sourced from current BSD
        distributions, which are under the 'BSD-License'.

        The specific modules are located thru-out the code base.

Topic:          ucpp

        *GRIEF* utilises 'ucpp' as its preprocessor, integrated into the
        Macro Compiler as an external stand-alone program as the initial
        stage of macro compilation.

        A C preprocessor is a part of a C compiler responsible for macro
        replacement, conditional compilation and inclusion of header files.
        It is often found as a stand-alone program on Unix systems.

        ucpp is such a preprocessor; it is designed to be quick and light,
        but anyway fully compliant to the ISO standard 9899:1999, also known
        as C99.

        ucpp can be compiled as a stand-alone program, or linked to some
        other code; in the latter case, ucpp will output tokens, one at a
        time, on demand, as an integrated lexer.

    Operational Modes:

        lexer mode - ucpp
            is linked to some other code and outputs a stream of tokens (each
            call to the lex() function will yield one token)

        on-lexer - ucpp
            preprocesses text and outputs the resulting text to a file
            descriptor; if linked to some other code, the cpp() function must
            be called repeatedly, otherwise ucpp is a stand-alone binary.
            ucpp was written by Thomas Pornin.

Topic:          makedepend

        Modified version of makedepend 1.0.4

        'makedepend' was developed as part of MIT's Project Athena. It was
        used extensively in building X11 and ancillary packages, but has
        since become superseded by the dependency generation facilities of
        various compilers, and is now used primarily as a worst-case
        fallback, e.g. by depcomp and GNU Automake.

        The master development code repository can be found at.

Topic:          extags

        Exuberant Ctags.

        Author, Darren Hiebert <dhiebert at users.sourceforge.net>

        Exuberant Ctags is a multilanguage reimplementation of the
        much-underused ctags(1) program and is intended to be the mother of
        all ctags programs. It generates indexes of source code definitions
        which are used by a number of editors and tools. The motivation
        which drove the development of Exuberant Ctags was the need for a
        ctags program which supported generation of tags for all possible C
        language constructs (which no other ctags offers), and because most
        were easily fooled by a number of preprocessor contructs.

        No components of Exuberant Ctags are included within GRIEF, other
        then the 'public domain' readtags.c module, which is utilised to
        read tags file generated by Exuberant.

        Exuberant Ctags is seperately licensed under the GNU GPL; see the
        source for details.

Topic:          Oniguruma

        Oniguruma is a regular expressions library.

        Oniguruma by K. Kosako is a BSD licensed regular expression
        library that supports a variety of character encodings.

        The Ruby programming language, since version 1.9, as well as
        PHP's multi-byte string module (since PHP5), use Oniguruma as
        their regular expression engine. It is also used in products
        such as Tera Term, TextMate, Sublime Text and SubEthaEdit.

        Oniguruma is Japanese for "Devil's Chariot".

Topic:          TRE

        TRE, The free and portable approximate regex matching library.

        TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant
        regexp matching library with some exciting features such as
        approximate (fuzzy) matching.

        The matching algorithm used in TRE uses linear worst-case
        time in the length of the text being searched, and quadratic
        worst-case time in the length of the used regular expression.
        In other words, the time complexity of the algorithm is
        O(M2N), where M is the length of the regular expression and N
        is the length of the text. The used space is also quadratic
        on the length of the regex, but does not depend on the
        searched string. This quadratic behaviour occurs only on
        pathological cases which are probably very rare in practice.

        Source: http://laurikari.net/tre/

    Features:

        TRE is not just yet another regexp matcher. TRE has some
        features which are not there in most free POSIX compatible
        implementations. Most of these features are not present in
        non-free implementations either, for that matter.

          o Approximate matching.

          o Strict standard conformance.

          o Predictable matching speed.

          o Portable.

          o Free.

Topic:          libteken

        libteken: terminal emulator library

        It is currently used by FreeBSD's console driver. libteken is
        a terminal emulator, which implements a fair amount of escape
        sequences used by VT100, xterm and cons25.

        Traditionally the FreeBSD console driver (syscons) uses the
        cons25 terminal type. This terminal type is basically a very
        compact subset of later VT-devices or graphical terminals
        like xterm. There are two problems with this approach.

            o Many other operating systems do not ship cons25 termcap
                entries.

            o Many embedded devices with serial or telnet interfaces
                only support VT100-style escape sequences.

        has to handle an input file which is supplied without any
        encoding metadata.

        Recognised character set.

           o UTF-8.
           o UTF-16 (BE and LE).
           o UTF-32 (BE and LE).
           o windows-1252 (mostly equivalent to iso8859-1).

Topic:          libguess

        High-speed character set detection.

        libguess-1.1 employs discrete-finite automata to deduce the
        character set of the input buffer. The advantage of this is
        that all character sets can be checked in parallel, and
        quickly. Right now, libguess passes a byte to each DFA on the
        same pass, meaning that the winning character set can be
        deduced as efficiently as possible.

        hunspell 1.3.2

        Hunspell is the spell checker of LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org,
        Mozilla Firefox 3 & Thunderbird, Google Chrome, and it is
        also used by proprietary software packages, like Mac OS X,
        InDesign, memoQ, Opera and SDL Trados.

        Source: http://hunspell.sourceforge.net

   Main features:

        o Extended support for language peculiarities; Unicode character
          encoding, compounding and complex morphology.

        o Improved suggestion using n-gram similarity, rule and dictionary
          based pronunciation data.

        o Morphological analysis, stemming and generation.

        o Hunspell is based on MySpell and works also with MySpell dictionaries.

        o C++ library under GPL/LGPL/MPL tri-license.

        o Interfaces and ports: AndroidHunspellService (for Android, based on
          he Chromium fork of Hunspell), Enchant (Generic spelling library
          from the Abiword project), XSpell (Mac OS X port, but Hunspell is
          part of the OS X from version 10.6 (Snow Leopard), and now it is
          enough to place the Hunspell dictionary files into ~/Library/Spelling
          or /Library/Spelling for spell checking), Delphi, Java (JNA, JNI),
          Perl, .NET, Python, Ruby ([1], [2], [3]), UNO, RichEdit.

Topic:          libarchive

        libarchive 3.0.4

        C library and command-line tools for reading and writing tar, cpio,
        zip, ISO, and other archive formats.

        Source: http://www.libarchive.org

    Library features:

        o Support for a variety of archive and compression formats.

        o Robust automatic format detection, including archive/compression
          combinations such as tar.gz.

        o Zero-copy internal architecture for high performance.

        o Streaming architecture eliminates all limits on size of archive,
          limits on entry sizes depend on particular formats.

        o Carefully factored code to minimize bloat when programs are
          statically linked.

        o Growing test suite to verify correctness of new ports.

        o Works on most POSIX-like systems (including FreeBSD,
          Linux, Solaris, etc.)

        o Supports Windows, including Cygwin, MinGW, and Visual Studio.
