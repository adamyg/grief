Title:          Third Party Packages

        *GRIEF* development would not be possible without the work of
        others.

        The following packages are normally only required for Windows
        builds as all are generally available on other targets, either as
        standard or optional installations.

Topic:          Common Modules

        A number of source modules have been sourced from current BSD
        distributions, which are under the 'BSD-License'.

        The specific modules are located thru-out the code base.

Topic:          ucpp

        *GRIEF* utilises 'ucpp' as its preprocessor, integrated into the
        Macro Compiler as an external stand-alone program as the initial
        stage of macro compilation.

        A C preprocessor is a part of a C compiler responsible for macro
        replacement, conditional compilation and inclusion of header files.
        It is often found as a stand-alone program on Unix systems.

        ucpp is such a preprocessor; it is designed to be quick and light,
        but anyway fully compliant to the ISO standard 9899:1999, also known
        as C99.

        ucpp can be compiled as a stand-alone program, or linked to some
        other code; in the latter case, ucpp will output tokens, one at a
        time, on demand, as an integrated lexer.

    Operational Modes:

        lexer mode - ucpp
            is linked to some other code and outputs a stream of tokens (each
            call to the lex() function will yield one token)

        on-lexer - ucpp
            preprocesses text and outputs the resulting text to a file
            descriptor; if linked to some other code, the cpp() function must
            be called repeatedly, otherwise ucpp is a stand-alone binary.
            ucpp was written by Thomas Pornin.

Topic:          makedepend

        Modified version of makedepend 1.0.4

        'makedepend' was developed as part of MIT's Project Athena. It was
        used extensively in building X11 and ancillary packages, but has
        since become superseded by the dependency generation facilities of
        various compilers, and is now used primarily as a worst-case
        fallback, e.g. by depcomp and GNU Automake.

        The master development code repository can be found at.

Topic:          mandoc

        The *mandoc* UNIX manpage compiler toolset.

        Modified version of mandoc 1.13.4 (July 10, 2016) using sqlite3
        (version 3.16.2).  Minor modifications to allow win32 builds.

        mandoc is a suite of tools compiling mdoc, the roff macro
        language of choice for BSD manual pages, and man, the
        predominant historical language for UNIX manuals. It is small,
        ISO C, ISC-licensed, and quite fast.

        The main component of the toolset is the mandoc utility program,
        based on the libmandoc validating compiler, to format output for
        UNIX terminals (with support for wide-character locales), XHTML,
        HTML, PostScript, and PDF.

        mandoc has predominantly been developed on OpenBSD and is both
        an OpenBSD and a BSD.lv project. We strive to support all
        interested free operating systems, in particular DragonFly,
        NetBSD, FreeBSD, Minix 3, and GNU/Linux, as well as all systems
        running the pkgsrc portable package build system.

Topic:          extags

        Exuberant Ctags.

        Author, Darren Hiebert <dhiebert at users.sourceforge.net>

        Exuberant Ctags is a multilanguage reimplementation of the
        much-underused ctags(1) program and is intended to be the mother of
        all ctags programs. It generates indexes of source code definitions
        which are used by a number of editors and tools. The motivation
        which drove the development of Exuberant Ctags was the need for a
        ctags program which supported generation of tags for all possible C
        language constructs (which no other ctags offers), and because most
        were easily fooled by a number of preprocessor contructs.

        No components of Exuberant Ctags are included within GRIEF, other
        then the 'public domain' readtags.c module, which is utilised to
        read tags file generated by Exuberant.

        Exuberant Ctags is seperately licensed under the GNU GPL; see the
        source for details.

Topic:          Oniguruma

        Oniguruma is a regular expressions library.

        Oniguruma by K. Kosako is a BSD licensed regular expression
        library that supports a variety of character encodings.

        The Ruby programming language, since version 1.9, as well as
        PHP's multi-byte string module (since PHP5), use Oniguruma as
        their regular expression engine. It is also used in products
        such as Tera Term, TextMate, Sublime Text and SubEthaEdit.

        Oniguruma is Japanese for "Devil's Chariot".

Topic:          TRE

        TRE, The free and portable approximate regex matching library.

        TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant
        regexp matching library with some exciting features such as
        approximate (fuzzy) matching.

        The matching algorithm used in TRE uses linear worst-case
        time in the length of the text being searched, and quadratic
        worst-case time in the length of the used regular expression.
        In other words, the time complexity of the algorithm is
        O(M2N), where M is the length of the regular expression and N
        is the length of the text. The used space is also quadratic
        on the length of the regex, but does not depend on the
        searched string. This quadratic behaviour occurs only on
        pathological cases which are probably very rare in practice.

        Source: http://laurikari.net/tre/

    Features:

        TRE is not just yet another regexp matcher. TRE has some
        features which are not there in most free POSIX compatible
        implementations. Most of these features are not present in
        non-free implementations either, for that matter.

          o Approximate matching.

          o Strict standard conformance.

          o Predictable matching speed.

          o Portable.

          o Free.

Topic:          libteken

        libteken: terminal emulator library

        It is currently used by FreeBSD's console driver. libteken is
        a terminal emulator, which implements a fair amount of escape
        sequences used by VT100, xterm and cons25.

        Traditionally the FreeBSD console driver (syscons) uses the
        cons25 terminal type. This terminal type is basically a very
        compact subset of later VT-devices or graphical terminals
        like xterm. There are two problems with this approach.

            o Many other operating systems do not ship cons25 termcap
                entries.

            o Many embedded devices with serial or telnet interfaces
                only support VT100-style escape sequences.

        This library provides a highly accurate set of heuristics
        that attempt to determine the character set used to encode
        some input text. This is extremely useful when your program
        has to handle an input file which is supplied without any
        encoding metadata.

        Recognised character set.

           o UTF-8.
           o UTF-16 (BE and LE).
           o UTF-32 (BE and LE).

Topic:          libguess

        High-speed character set detection.

        libguess-1.1 employs discrete-finite automata to deduce the
        character set of the input buffer. The advantage of this is
        that all character sets can be checked in parallel, and
        quickly. Right now, libguess passes a byte to each DFA on the
        same pass, meaning that the winning character set can be
        deduced as efficiently as possible.

        Zlib Data compress library.

        A Massively Spiffy Yet Delicately Unobtrusive Compression
        Library (Also Free, Not to Mention Unencumbered by Patents)

        zlib 1.2.7 is a general purpose data compression library. All
        the code is thread safe. The data format used by the zlib
        library is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to
        1952 in the files http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950 (zlib
        format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and rfc1952 (gzip format).

        Source: http://www.zlib.net/

    Acknowledgement:

        The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The
        deflate and zlib specifications were written by L. Peter
        Deutsch. Thanks to all the people who reported problems and
        suggested various improvements in zlib; they are too numerous

Topic:          libbzip2

        bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.

        The bzip2 file compression program was developed by Julian Seward and
        launched on the 18th of July in 1996. It has remained an open source
        program, available to all for free, for over twenty two years now.
        The last stable release was seven years ago. The version 1.0.6 was
        released on the 20th of September in 2010. bzip2 compression program
        is based on BurrowsWheeler algorithm. The program can compress files
        but cannot archive them. Julian Seward is still in charge of
        maintaining the program. The compression application works on all
        major operating systems and is available as a BSD-like license. The
        program uses .bz2 as its filename extension, application/x-bzip2 as
        the media type on internet and public.archive.bzip2 as the uniform
        type identifier.

        It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best
        available techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors),
        whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster
        at decompression.

Topic:          liblzma

        XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with a
        high compression ratio. XZ Utils were written for POSIX-like systems,
        but also work on some not-so-POSIX systems. XZ Utils are the
        successor to LZMA Utils.

        The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on LZMA SDK, but
        it has been modified quite a lot to be suitable for XZ Utils. The
        primary compression algorithm is currently LZMA2, which is used
        inside the .xz container format. With typical files, XZ Utils create
        30 % smaller output than gzip and 15 % smaller output than bzip2.

        XZ Utils consist of several components:

         o liblzma is a compression library with an API similar to that of zlib.

         o xz is a command line tool with syntax similar to that of gzip.

         o xzdec is a decompression-only tool smaller than the full-featured xz tool.

         o A set of shell scripts (xzgrep, xzdiff, etc.) have been adapted
           from gzip to ease viewing, grepping, and comparing compressed files.

         o Emulation of command line tools of LZMA Utils eases transition from LZMA Utils to XZ Utils.

        While liblzma has a zlib-like API, liblzma doesn't include any file
        I/O functions. A separate I/O library is planned, which would
        abstract handling of .gz, .bz2, and .xz files with an easy to use API.

        Source: https://tukaani.org/xz/

    XZ Utils Copyright:

(code)
    Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
    is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
    package (but check the individual files to be sure!):

      - liblzma is in the public domain.

      - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
        domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
        in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
        GNU LGPLv2.1+.

      - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
        adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
        under GNU GPLv2+.

      - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
        XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
        are in the public domain.

      - Translated messages are in the public domain.

      - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
        are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
        in the binaries being built.

      - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
        utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.

      - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
        that are under various free software licenses.

    You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
    the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
    take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
    the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
    lawyers.

    As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.

    If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
    into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
    polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
    naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
    notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:

        This software includes code from XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>.

    The following license texts are included in the following files:
      - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
      - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
      - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3

    Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
    pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
    binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
    even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
    package.

    If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
    information.
