 * Routine to perform cursor addressing.
 * CM is a string containing printf type escapes to allow
 * cursor addressing.  We start out ready to print the destination
 * line, and switch each time we print row or column.
 * The following escapes are defined for substituting row/column:
 *
 *      %d      as in printf
 *      %2      like %2d
 *      %3      like %3d
 *      %.      gives %c hacking special case characters
 *      %+x     like %c but adding x first
 *
 * The codes below affect the state but don't use up a value.
 *
 *      %>xy    if value > x add y
 *      %r      reverses row/column
 *      %i      increments row/column (for one origin indexing)
 *      %%      gives %
 *      %B      BCD (2 decimal digits encoded in one byte)
 *      %D      Delta Data (backwards bcd)
 *
 * all other characters are ``self-inserting''.
